# Patricia (Glover) Maker-Checker Task

## Introduction

A maker-checker system revolves around the idea that for any change to be made to user
information by an administrator, it must be approved by a fellow administrator in order to take
effect; and if the request is declined, the change isnâ€™t persisted.
